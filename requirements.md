# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on deploying the complete Verificadores platform to production environments, making it accessible online through public URLs. The deployment will include the backend API, web application, database, monitoring systems, and CI/CD automation to ensure the platform is live and accessible to real users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want the Verificadores platform deployed to production servers, so that users can access the application through public URLs on the internet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the web application SHALL be accessible via a public domain (e.g., https://verificadores.com)
2. WHEN users visit the web application THEN the system SHALL load the React frontend with full functionality
3. WHEN the backend API is deployed THEN it SHALL be accessible via HTTPS endpoints
4. WHEN the database is deployed THEN it SHALL persist data reliably in a production environment
5. IF the deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines configured, so that code changes are automatically tested and deployed to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL automatically run tests and deploy if successful
2. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL automatically build Docker images and push to container registry
3. WHEN deployment starts THEN the system SHALL perform zero-downtime deployment
4. IF tests fail THEN the deployment SHALL be blocked and notifications sent
5. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL verify all services are healthy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the production environment configured with proper security and monitoring, so that the application runs safely and performance can be tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the production environment is set up THEN all services SHALL use HTTPS/TLS encryption
2. WHEN the application is running THEN monitoring dashboards SHALL be accessible showing system health
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL send alerts to administrators
4. WHEN users access the application THEN rate limiting and security headers SHALL be applied
5. IF security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically apply patches where possible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the application to be fast and reliable, so that I can use the verification services without interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the web application THEN pages SHALL load within 3 seconds
2. WHEN the API receives requests THEN responses SHALL be returned within 500ms for standard operations
3. WHEN high traffic occurs THEN the system SHALL auto-scale to handle increased load
4. IF a service fails THEN the system SHALL automatically restart and maintain 99.9% uptime
5. WHEN users upload files THEN the CDN SHALL serve optimized content globally

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want the deployment costs optimized and infrastructure documented, so that the platform is economically sustainable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the infrastructure is deployed THEN costs SHALL be monitored and optimized for efficiency
2. WHEN services are provisioned THEN they SHALL use appropriate sizing for expected load
3. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL include deployment procedures and troubleshooting guides
4. IF costs exceed budget THEN alerts SHALL be sent and auto-scaling limits applied
5. WHEN maintenance is needed THEN clear procedures SHALL be available for common operations
