# Production Deployment Design

## Overview

This design outlines the complete production deployment strategy for the Verificadores platform, including cloud infrastructure, CI/CD automation, monitoring, and security configurations. The deployment will use AWS services with Docker containers, automated pipelines, and comprehensive monitoring to ensure a reliable, scalable, and secure production environment.

## Data Models

### Environment Configuration

```typescript
interface DeploymentEnvironment {
  name: 'staging' | 'production';
  domain: string;
  apiUrl: string;
  databaseUrl: string;
  redisUrl: string;
  s3Bucket: string;
  cdnDomain: string;
  monitoring: {
    grafanaUrl: string;
    prometheusUrl: string;
    kibanaUrl: string;
  };
  scaling: {
    minInstances: number;
    maxInstances: number;
    targetCpuUtilization: number;
  };
}
```

### Infrastructure as Code

```yaml
# terraform/main.tf structure
resource "aws_ecs_cluster" "verificadores" {
  name = "verificadores-${var.environment}"
  
  setting {
    name  = "containerInsights"
    value = "enabled"
  }
}

resource "aws_ecs_service" "backend" {
  name            = "backend-service"
  cluster         = aws_ecs_cluster.verificadores.id
  task_definition = aws_ecs_task_definition.backend.arn
  desired_count   = var.backend_instance_count
  
  load_balancer {
    target_group_arn = aws_lb_target_group.backend.arn
    container_name   = "backend"
    container_port   = 3000
  }
  
  deployment_configuration {
    maximum_percent         = 200
    minimum_healthy_percent = 100
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

### Deployment Failure Recovery

1. **Automated Rollback**
   - Health check failures trigger automatic rollback
   - Database migration failures prevent deployment
   - Container startup failures revert to previous version

2. **Manual Recovery Procedures**
   - Emergency rollback commands
   - Database backup restoration
   - Service restart procedures

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Real-time deployment status monitoring
   - Slack/email notifications for failures
   - Automated incident creation in monitoring systems

### Application Error Handling

1. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Prevent cascade failures between services
   - Automatic recovery when services are healthy
   - Fallback responses for degraded functionality

2. **Graceful Degradation**
   - Core functionality remains available during partial outages
   - Non-critical features disabled during high load
   - User-friendly error messages

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Deployment Testing

1. **Automated Test Suite**
   - Unit tests (90%+ coverage)
   - Integration tests for API endpoints
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Performance tests for load validation

2. **Security Testing**
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Container image security scanning
   - Infrastructure security validation
   - Penetration testing (quarterly)

### Post-Deployment Validation

1. **Smoke Tests**
   - Critical functionality verification
   - API endpoint health checks
   - Database connectivity validation
   - External service integration tests

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Response time monitoring
   - Throughput measurement
   - Error rate tracking
   - Resource utilization monitoring

### Staging Environment Testing

1. **Production-like Environment**
   - Same infrastructure configuration as production
   - Realistic data volumes for testing
   - Full monitoring and logging setup

2. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Stakeholder validation before production deployment
   - Mobile app testing on staging environment
   - Performance validation under load

## Security Considerations

### Infrastructure Security

1. **Network Security**
   - VPC with private subnets for databases
   - Security groups with minimal required access
   - WAF rules for common attack patterns
   - DDoS protection via CloudFront

2. **Access Control**
   - IAM roles with least privilege principle
   - Multi-factor authentication for AWS console
   - Service-to-service authentication via IAM roles
   - Secrets management via AWS Secrets Manager

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption at rest for databases and S3
   - Encryption in transit via HTTPS/TLS
   - Database connection encryption
   - Secure backup storage

### Application Security

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - JWT token validation
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management via Redis
   - API rate limiting

2. **Input Validation**
   - Request validation middleware
   - SQL injection prevention
   - XSS protection headers
   - File upload security
